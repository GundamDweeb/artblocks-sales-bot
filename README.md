# artblocks-sales-bot
This sales bot is a fork of [The Curio Cards sales bot](https://github.com/crypt0biwan/curio-sales-bot). Modified to work with the v0 and v1 contracts of Artblocks.
You can see the tweets it outputs at [https://twitter.com/artblocks_sales](https://twitter.com/artblocks_sales)

Special thanks to [Kian](https://github.com/fafrd) who initially setup the source of the bot ðŸ«¡

# Setup
Make sure you have the proper Node version installed (see `.nvmrc` file)

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`.

## Infura

You'll need to get set up with an Infura account- log in to https://infura.io/ and create a new project. In `.env`, populate these 2 values 
```
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=
INFURA_SECRET=
```

## Discord 
Next you'll need to set up a Discord webhook. In your server go to Settings -> Integrations and create a webhook. Set the DISCORD_ID to the first value and DISCORD_TOKEN to the second value.

For example... if your webhook URL is `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234123412341234/asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf`, set the .env file with
```
DISCORD_ID=1234123412341234
DISCORD_TOKEN=asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
```

## Twitter
Setting up the twitter part is a bit complicated. It was a pain to figure out how to get the API keys. Do the following steps:
- Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
- you'll need to apply to become an api user, first. The application might take a few days.
- when that's complete, create an app (NOT a 'standalone' app) here https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps
- create a Production environment within the app. The name of this environment will be attached to each tweet, so make it good. Note the api key and secret.
- settings -> set OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 turned on, MAKE SURE YOU ALLOW READ/WRITE PERMS
- go back to Keys and Tokens, generate "Access Token and Secret", note the access token+token secret.
- plop the details into your .env file
```
TWITTER_API_KEY=
TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

# Running
```
npm start
```

# Testing
Make sure you set the infura values in .env. The tests will contact the ethereum node.
```
npm test
```
If you want to test an individual test you can install mocha globally `npm i -g mocha` and specify the test this way
```
mocha -g "handleTransfer()"
```

# Contracts
```
0x059edd72cd353df5106d2b9cc5ab83a52287ac3a      Artblocks v0 contract (Chromie Squiggles, Genesis and Construction Token)

```

# Media
The Artblocks API supports v0 and v1 tokens. For social purposes it is good to use the thumb images, like this:
